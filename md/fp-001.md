# Functional Programming
> What does it mean to make code or something more functional? Is that the opposite of relational databases?

Functional programming dates back to the 1930's. It is spawned from Lambda calculus, which was a system that expressed computations using functions.

Functional programming is simply a way of writing **predictable** code that is:

- Easy to test.
- Easy to debug.
- Easy to maintain.
- Easy to scale.

The two most commonly practiced ideas of FP are "pure functions" and "immutability."

### Pure Functions

Here is an example of an un-pure function.

The function is not pure because it relies on data that is _not_ provided to it. Pure functions are safe and predictable because as long as they are provided with valid data, they will always work. Un-pure functions, such as the one above, may break due to _something else in the application_ changing.

Here's a pure version of this function.

In this function, as long as a string `name` is provided to `yellAtPerson`, it will work.

In the un-pure example, `yellAtPerson` could break if `person` was "mutated" (changed), for example, as seen here.

The point here is that a pure function is easy to debug because it only depends on the arguments provided to it. So we can see if the provided argument is correct, and, if so, the error we are facing is a problem within the function. Otherwise, the error has nothing to do with this function, even if the error happened here.

### Immutability

In the examples above, I we saw `person.name` be mutated. Because it changed, the application broke. Immutability is, simply put, the practice of _not changing values_. If values don't change then the application is much much less likely to break.
