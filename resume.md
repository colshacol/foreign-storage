## Installation

To add Colton to your team, simply give HR the thumbs up to begin onboarding Colton.

```sh
$ hr onboard colshacol
```

## Usage

### `beHereOnTime`

Use this method to tell Colton what time to arrive at the office every day.
(Colton shows up at 9am by default, so most users will never need to use this.)

```js
Colton.beHereOnTime('9:30am')
```

### `moveFastAndDontBreakThings`

Although Colton is interested in the best solutions to problems, he is also
aware that code must be delivered in a timely manner and automatically adjusts
to meet your team's expectations. Colton has built in testing capabilities that
ensure that the code he contributes to your project doex exactly what the
requirements state and does not break previously existing implementations.
(Also enabled by default.)

```js
Colton.moveFastAndDontBreakThings()
```

### `adaptQuickly`

Colton knows that knowing how to code is cheap and that actual value is in the
ability to package business logic inside of code. Being a JavaScript developer
first and foremost, Colton can adapt to any new technologies with ease, and prefers
to do so in order to stay relevant and grow his skills. (Also enabled by default.)

```js
Colton.adaptQuickly()
```

## Extended API

All of the extended API methods return `true` no matter what.

### `isATeamPlayer`

During the three years that Colton has been in production, he found that what
lacked most in various workplaces was community. One thing that is most important
to him is to be able to collaborate with others, accept that he is not always right,
and share goals and accomplishments.

```js
Colton.isATeamPlayer() // true
```

### `hasLeadershipSkills`

Having been classified as a Senior developer for 2.5 years and lead teams at Fortune
100 companies, Colton thinks of himself as a strong leader, and others must agree. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
He has trained developers from 0 knowledge to employment, contributed to the development
of the community and JS ecosystem, and had plans to give talks at conferences before his
career ate him alive. :(

```js
Colton.hasLeadershipSkills() // true
```

### `hasCommunicationSkills`

Developers have to translate the ideas of product owners and business into complex
implementations in code, teach and train other team members, and ensure that he/she
is communicative at all times with the team. Colton excels in this field, as his
ability to comminicate with and understand people is built upon his interest and study
in different behavioral and cognitive psychologies.

```js
Colton.hasCommunicationSkills() // true
```

## Experience

### The Container Store, Senior Full Stack Developer (05/2019 - Present)  

Currently working on revamping The Container Store's Design Tools UI that is used internally and externally.
  
### factoryfunction, Founder, Owner, Teacher (01/2019 - Present) 

In 2019, Colton started his own side project, factoryfunction, that is is in the web development consulting and
training space. Although factoryfunction isn't in full force just yet, it has served a few short term contracts
with notable companies including Mulseoft, to name one.  
  
On the training side of things, Colton uses factoryfunction to empower and inspire the developers of tomorrow,
offering free mentorship and assessments.
  
### Copart, Senior JavaScript Developer (04/2018 - 02/2019)  

Copart needed somebody to create an ecosystem of tools that allowed them to break down their main monolithic
application into dozens of smaller, independent applications living in their own repositories. To achieve this,
Colton had to dive deep into every part of the company's code and UI related business logic to see how everything
was tied together, and determine how it could be carefully sliced apart. To give a litte bit of insight as to how
complex of a task this was, just know that everything in the monilithic app was tied together with a massive Redux
store, so an "inner" app could not really exist without it.  
  
12 npm packages (including React components, Webpack plugins, and CLI tools) and 4 months later, Copart's applications
were finally able to being breaking off with almost no effort and absolutely 0 configuration. The tools built focused
on developer experience and seamless transitions.  
  
### Zyston, UI Extraordinaire (02/2018 - 04/2018)  

Zyston had their client-facing IPAAS dashboard built with React / Semantic UI / Meteor by two C++ developers with no
prior JavaScript knowledge. Although these two developers did an amazing job given the circumstances, Zyston needed it
to be more performant, more reliable, and more aesthetically pleasing.  
  
Colton re-designed and rebuilt the UI and UX for Zyston's IPAAS Dashboard and exceeded all expectations of quality
and delivery.
  
### Sabre, Senior JavaScript Developer (07/2017 - 01/2018)  

Hired to be on a 5 person "SWAT" team called "NGVA Unicorn", Colton worked to support the NGVA team in fixing bugs and
adding features to their product in the months leading up to a massive new client coming on.  
  
After the crossover, Colton lead development of a new Sabre product (GX) that... did a bunch of things that he is
not allowed to discuss, given the legal jargon in his contract.  

### Verizon, Lead Front End Developer (10/2016 - 05/2018)  

At Verizon, Colton helped hire and train a team to work on the upcoming Verizon Cloud Platform. He really doesn't remember
more of the "implementation details" of this experience. >.<
  
## Education

Colton is self taught. In 2015, after dabbling in web development for over 10 years, Colton sat down in a dark room
and began to study front end development tirelessly. After 9 months of unhuman commitment to his study, he was finally able
land a job and start his new career. (This is also the subject of many of his Quora answers that brought him to be a top
author in Web Development on Quora in 2017.)
